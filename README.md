## 🧠 Training the RL Agent

1. Clone IsaacLab and follow setup instructions  
2. Clone this repo and install any Python dependencies required by IsaacLab and rl-games.

3. Start training:

```bash
cd source/Sweap_Task
python scripts/rl_games/train.py --task=Template-Mydog-Marl-Direct-v0
```

---

## 🤖 Deploying to Hardware

- Use STM32CubeIDE to open `firmware/pwm_test.ioc`
- Compile and flash to the robot controller board
- Use ROS 2 packages under `ros2_ws/src/run_saodi/` and `ros2_ws/src/wit_ros2_imu/` for hardware integration

---

## 📡 ROS 2 Interface

- `cmd_vel` for velocity control  
- `laser_scan` or `odom` as optional inputs  
- Launch file: `ros2 launch run_saodi start_robot.launch.py`
- IMU launch: `ros2 launch wit_ros2_imu imu.launch.py`
